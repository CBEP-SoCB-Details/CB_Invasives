# Introduction
This Notebook provides an updated graphics for the MIMIC invasive species 
monitoring program from Casco Bay. The primary changes are to the labels used
for each site, and rescaling the graphics

The Marine Invader Monitoring and Information Collaborative (MIMIC) in Casco Bay 
is a partnership between CBEP, the Wells National Estuarine Research Reserve 
(Wells NERR), and the regional MIMIC program.  The Regional effort includes 
participants from several other New England States.

Wells NERR trains community scientists to identify (currently) 23 species of 
invasives, including tunicates, bryozoans, algae and crustaceans. Scientists 
visit sites monthly between May and October and document abundance of these 
non-native species.

# Add Order Factors
We need to organize graphics by island in consistent structure.
We will use a bar chart, organized by Island and a common sequence within island 
groups.  To facilitate that, we need a factor that orders sites consistently
within island groups.  While we are at it, we create alternate labels for 
the plots.

```{r}
orders <- tribble (
  ~Site,                            ~Order,      ~Label,
  "Spring Point Marina",               1,         "Spring Point Marina",  
  "SMCC Dock",                         2,         "SMCC Dock",
  "Siegel's Reef",                     3,         "Siegel's Reef",  
  
  "Peaks Dock",                        1,          "Peaks Dock",          
  "Peaks Tidepool",                    2,          "Peaks Tidepool", 
  
  "Great Diamond Island Dock",         1,          "Great Diamond Dock",    
  "Great Diamond Island Tidepool",     2,          "Great Diamond Tidepool",
  
  "Long Island Dock",                  1,          "Long Island Dock",  
  "Fowler's Tide Pool",                2,          "Fowler's Beach",   
  
  "Chandlers Wharf Dock",              1,          "Chandlers Wharf",  
  "Chebeague Stone Pier",              2,          "Stone Pier",   
  "Waldo Point" ,                      3,          "Waldo Point")
```


```{r}
abundance_data <- abundance_data %>%
  left_join(orders, by = 'Site')

presence_data <- presence_data %>%
  left_join(orders, by = 'Site')
```

# Recent Data Only
```{r}
recent_data <- presence_data %>% 
  filter(Year > 2015)
```


# Summary Statistics By Site

```{r}
total_spp <- recent_data %>%
  group_by(Site, Where, Type, Order, Label, Species) %>%
  summarize(Spotted = any(Present),
            .groups = 'drop_last') %>%
  group_by(Site, Where, Type, Order, Label) %>%
  summarize(Tot_Species = sum(Spotted),
            .groups = 'drop')

avg_spp <- recent_data %>%
  group_by(Site, Date) %>%
  summarize(spp_present = sum(Present),
            .groups = 'drop') %>%
  group_by(Site) %>%
  summarize(Avg_Species = mean(spp_present),
            .groups = 'drop')

total_spp <- total_spp %>%
  left_join(avg_spp, by = 'Site')
rm(avg_spp)
```

## Create Long Version for Facet Plot
```{r}
total_spp_long <- total_spp %>%
  pivot_longer(c(Tot_Species, Avg_Species),
               names_to = 'Parameter', 
               values_to = 'Value')
```

# Faceted Plots
## Create Facet Labels
```{r fig.width = 7}
mylabs <- c('Total Invasives', 'Average Invasives\nPer Visit')
names(mylabs) = c('Tot_Species', 'Avg_Species')

mylabs
```

## Wide Facet
We rescaled this to fit more closely with the final page layout.
```{r fig.width = 3, fig.height = 3.75}
ggplot(total_spp_long, aes(x = Where, y = Value, group = Order, fill = Type)) +
  geom_col(position = 'dodge') +
  
  geom_text(aes(label = Label, y = 0.25), 
            position = position_dodge(0.9),
            angle = 90, 
            hjust = 0,
            vjust = 0.25,
            size = 1.5) +
  
  facet_wrap(~Parameter, labeller = labeller(Parameter = mylabs),  scales = 'fixed') +
  
  ylab('') +
  xlab('') +
  
  scale_fill_manual(values = cbep_colors2()[c(2,4)], name = '') +
  
  guides(fill = guide_legend(override.aes = list(size = 0.25))) +

                                   hjust = 1
                                   ),
        legend.position = c(0.125, 0.85),
        legend.title = element_text(size = 6), 
        legend.text = element_text(size = 6),
        legend.key.size = unit(.125, "in"),
        axis.ticks.length.x = unit(0, 'cm'))
